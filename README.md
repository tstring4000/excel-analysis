Project Title: Excel Analysis

Description: Have you ever encountered an Excel file that was a total mess with a ton of sheets, and you have no idea
which ones are related? For example, each sheet could have a formula referencing another sheet(s), but you would have
to manually click through each sheet/cell (or use the find tool) to get an idea of which sheets rely on other sheets
for their formulas to work. This project aims to display the sheet interdependencies in an easy-to-understand graph(s).

Installation: Install/import dependencies via pip.

Usage: Place the Excel file you want to analyze in the input folder. Run main.py. Afterward, you may run 
graph_existing.py if you want to generate the graph again without having to redo the analysis.

Contributing: You can contribute by making pull requests or forking the repo.
